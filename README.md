## Contribution guidelines

The master branch holds the most recent stable version of the code 
vetted by the product owner. Your trainer will make a PR from your batch 
branch (convention: month and year-trainer name, e.g. 1807-Emily for 
Emily's batch which began in July 2018) into staging after your 
iteration. 

All branches off your batch branch must be prefixed with your batch's 
numeric identifier (e.g. 1807). Stray branches will be deleted. 

The sledgehammer branch is the product owner's own branch, please do not 
use this one.
